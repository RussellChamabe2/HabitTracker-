# TrackMyHabits (Python)

## Description
The Habit Tracker is a simple command line Python programme designed to help users build better daily routines.  
I created this project because I often forget what I need to do during the day, and I realised that a tool like this could help both me and others stay organised and consistent.

### Features
 Create a personalised list of habits or tasks  
 Add or remove habits as needed  
 Display daily habits in a clear, organised table using pandas  
 Keep track of progress day by day  

It is a beginner friendly project focused on developing practical programming skills in Python while solving a real everyday problem, which is staying consistent with good habits.

##  Technologies Used
   Python 3.14  
   Pandas (used for displaying habits in a table)

## How to Run
1. Open Command Prompt or Terminal.  
2. Navigate to the project folder. The path below is just an example showing where the HabitTracker folder might be located.  
   Find your own HabitTracker folder and open the subfolder named **TrackMyHabits**, which contains the two Python files(main.py and user.py).  

   Example command to type in Command Prompt:
   cd "C:\Users\robby\Downloads\HabitTracker\TrackMyHabits"



 Future Improvements
 
 Allow users to mark habits as Completed or Not Completed directly in the table
 Enable saving and loading of progress automatically
 Add a simple graphical interface in the future
