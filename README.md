# 🧠 Habit Tracker (Python)

## 📋 Description
The Habit Tracker is a simple command line Python programme designed to help users build better daily routines.  
I created this project because I often forget what I need to do during the day, and I realised that a tool like this could help both me and others stay organised and consistent.

### Features
📝 Create a personalised list of habits or tasks  
➕ Add or remove habits as needed  
📊 Display daily habits in a clear, organised table using pandas  
📅 Keep track of progress day by day  

It is a beginner friendly project focused on developing practical programming skills in Python while solving a real everyday problem, which is staying consistent with good habits.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

📈 Pandas (used for displaying habits in a table)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open Command Prompt or Terminal  
2. Navigate to the project folder  
   cd "path\to\HabitTracker"

💡 Future Improvements
